# Hybrid LCA Software for Hydrogen Air Travel Project

This repository contains the Hybrid LCA Software for Hydrogen Air Travel project, developed as part of the "TPK4852 Experts in Teams" course at NTNU. The project aims to highlight the environmental impacts of hydrogen-powered flights, facilitating intuitive analyses for promoting sustainable aviation choices.

## Project Contents

The project is structured with essential files facilitating communication from the backend to the frontend to create an interactive web interface:

- `app.js`: The React-based JavaScript file that constructs the frontend, managing the user interface.
- `app.css`: The CSS file that styles the frontend, enhancing the visual appeal of the web interface.
- `app.py`: A Flask application that serves as the backend server, handling requests and routing data to the frontend.

### Additional Components

- `Hybrid.py`: The main software component, containing the logic for environmental impact analysis of hydrogen air travel.
- `Data.xlsx`: A dataset file that houses the collected data used in the analysis.
- `background.png`: The image file used as a background for the web interface, adding aesthetic value to the user experience.

## Technology Stack

To successfully run and develop this project further, it is essential to utilize specific technologies:

- **Frontend Development**: The project leverages React for creating dynamic and responsive web interfaces. Ensure the React library is installed in Visual Studio for frontend development.
- **Backend Routing**: Flask is used to manage backend processes, including data handling and routing to the frontend. Installation of the Flask library is required for backend functionality.

Make sure to install React in Visual Studio and Flask to properly route backend processes to the frontend, ensuring seamless operation of the web interface.
